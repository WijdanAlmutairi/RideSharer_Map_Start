# RideSharer_Map_Start
This project is task 3 from **Lyft Mobile Engineering Virtual Experience Program** where the app asks the user 
permission to access their location to display it on the map and in case the user denies sharing the location 
an alert will pop up to the user with instructions to give the app permission to the user's location.

## Information
